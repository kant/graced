## Synopsis
GrACED stands for Grammar Agent for Classifying ES Databases. It is a graph based intelligent agent that studies the relational database of a given ES (Enterprise System) to determine if it abides to the classification of manufacturing information provided by the ANSI/ISA-95 (S95) international standard. The agent mainly works in English, but other languages can be added as synonyms.

GrACED was developed in the Institute for Development and Design, INGAR CONICET-UTN during 2014. It was initially made in Eclipse, using Java8, JavaFX, and XML files to hold its knowledge base. It has been updated to compile under IntelliJ Idea 2016.2.
